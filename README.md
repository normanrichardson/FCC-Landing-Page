# FCC-Landing-Page

This was put together for the Responsive Web Design course on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc21752981-84f1-47db-a786-eea26f47141e/responsive-web-design). The primary aim was to create a responsive product landing page. The inspiration for this project is [Acme Klien Bottle](https://www.kleinbottle.com/).

A demo can be found [here](https://normanrichardson.github.io/FCC-Landing-Page/). The unit tests can be run by selecting the "hamburger menu" in the top left and selecting the "product landing page" option.
